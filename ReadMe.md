# Relational-Databases-World-Cup-Database-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my seventh project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-world-cup-database-project/build-a-world-cup-database) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting and SQL skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-World-Cup-Database-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the sixth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Programming With Bash & SQL
For this project, I had to produce a Bash script that used complex SQL statements to obtain information about computer science from a database and alter said database. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-World-Cup-Database-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). To complete this task, I cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 140 Bash and SQL lessons. The notes I created when doing this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-World-Cup-Database-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-world-cup-databases-guided-project-course-notes.txt).
